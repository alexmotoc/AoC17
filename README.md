## Progress: 50/50 ‚≠ê

These are my solutions written in Python for the 25 puzzles from AoC2017. I tried to keep them as readable and easy to understand as possible which is why a lot of the code could be shortened.

If you have any suggestions for more concise/compact/elegant/more efficient solutions feel free to open an issue or add a pull request!
